-> Differerene between ${exp}  and *{exp}
  1. -> ${exp} are variable expressions - OGNL expressions ; when used in spring they are SpEL expressions.
        For e: ${spitter}, it resolves to model property whose key is spitter.
     -> *{exp} are selection expressions
     
  2. -> ${exp} are evaluated against the entire SpEL context
     -> *{exp} are evaluated on a selected object.
        In case of the form, the selected object is the one given in the <form> tag's th:object a "Spitter" object from the model.
        Therefore the *{firstName} expression evaluates to the firstName property on the Spitter object
