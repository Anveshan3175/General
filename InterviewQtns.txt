D-E-Shaw
1. Save all leaf nodes of a Binary tree in a Doubly Linked List by using Right node as Next node and Left Node as Previous Node.
2. Given an array,find the maximum j – i such that arr[j] > arr[i]
3. Remove Alternate Duplicate characters from a char array you have to do it in Place.Like keeping only the odd occurences of each   character.

        Example: Input: “you got beautiful eyes”
        Output: ”you gtbeaiful es”
        Allowed Time Complexity was O(n) and Space Complexity was O(1)
4. In a file there are 1 million words . Find 10 most frequent words in that file.
5. Find all nodes at k-distance from a given node in a binary tree
6. Clone a linked list with next and random pointer
7. Serialise and Deserialise a linked list with next and random pointer.
8. Construct a binary tree from given inorder and preorder traversals.
9. Return a tree such that each internal node stores sum of all its child nodes. Each leaf node stores zero.
10. How will you implement linked list with 1 million nodes? How will you access 999999 th node? Give some optimal design strategy and implementation.
11. Reversal of Linked List in groups of K.
12. Given a positive integer N, count all possible distinct binary strings of length N such that there are no consecutive 1’s.
13. Check whether given binary tree is balanced or not. Definition was no two leaves should have height difference of greater than one.
14. Remove duplicates from string in place in O(n).
15. Connect nodes on same level in a binary tree.
16. Find sum of data of all leaves of a binary tree on same level and then multiply sums obtained of all levels.
17. Given a matrix of characters and a word.
18. you have to count the number of occurrences of that word in that matrix. you can move to any of the eight valid directions from current position.
