To convert your private key (.pem to .ppk)

   1. Start PuTTYgen (for example, from the Start menu, choose All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTYgen).
   2. Under Type of key to generate, choose RSA.
   3. Choose Load. By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with the extension .ppk. To locate your .pem file, select the option to  display files of all types.
   4. Select your .pem file for the key pair that you specified when you launched your instance, and then choose Open. Choose OK to   dismiss the confirmation dialog box.
   5. Choose Save private key to save the key in the format that PuTTY can use. PuTTYgen displays a warning about saving the key without a passphrase. Choose Yes.
   6. Specify the same name for the key that you used for the key pair (for example, my-key-pair). PuTTY automatically adds the .ppk file extension.
   7. Start PuTTY (from the Start menu, choose All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY).
   8. In the Category pane, expand Connection, expand SSH, and then choose Auth. Complete the following:
        -> Choose Browse.
        -> Select the .ppk file that you generated for your key pair, and then choose Open.
        -> (Optional) If you plan to start this session again later, you can save the session information for future use. Choose Session in the Category tree, enter a name for the session in Saved Sessions, and then choose Save.
        -> Choose Open to start the PuTTY session.
