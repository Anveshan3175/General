-> Creating "Always Free" ubuntu instance. It is a COMPUTE instance
   - While creating compute instance, change the image from oracle linux to ubuntu
   - download the private key file and save it carefully
   To access the ubuntu instance from putty
   - Public IP : 152.67.174.164
   - user : ubuntu
   
   
   
-> To connect to a Linux instance from a Windows system using PuTTY
  SSH private key files generated by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are not compatible with PuTTY. If you are using a private key file generated during the instance 
  creation  process you need to convert the file to a .ppk file before you can use it with PuTTY to connect to the instance.

  -> Convert a generated .key private key file:
     - Open PuTTYgen.
     - Click Load, and select the private key generated when you created the instance. The extension for the key file is .key.
     - Click Save private key.
     - Specify a name for the key. The extension for new private key is is .ppk.
     - Click Save.
  -> Connect to the Linux instance using a .ppk private key file:
     - If the instance uses a key pair that you created using PuTTY Key Generator, use the following procedure.
     - Open PuTTY.
     - In the Category pane, select Session and enter the following:
     - Host Name (or IP address):   <username>@<public-ip-address>
        <username> is the default username for the instance. For Oracle Linux and CentOS images, the default username is opc.
        For Ubuntu images, the default username is ubuntu.
     - <public-ip-address> is your instance public IP address that you retrieved from the Console
     - Port: 22
     - Connection type: SSH
      - In the Category pane, expand Window, and then select Translation.
      - In the Remote character set drop-down list, select UTF-8. The default locale setting on Linux-based instances is UTF-8, and 
        this configures PuTTY to use the same locale.
      - In the Category pane, expand Connection, expand SSH, and then click Auth.
      - Click Browse, and then select your .ppk private key file.
      - Click Open to start the session.
      - If this is your first time connecting to the instance, you might see a message that the server's host key is not cached in the registry. 
        Click Yes to continue the connection.
